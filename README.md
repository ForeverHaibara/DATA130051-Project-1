## Assignment
Construct a two-layer neural network classifier including the three parts below. 

### Training
* Activation Functions
* Back Propagation with Loss and Gradient Computation
* Learning Rate Decay
* L2-Regularization
* Optimizer SGD
* Model Saving

### Hyperparameter Tuning 
* Learning Rate
* Hidden Layer Size
* Regularization

### Testing
Load the model with tuned hyperparameters and output the 
classification accuracy. 

<br>

Utilize the MNIST dataset, see more info at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. 

**DO NOT** use PyTorch, TensorFlow or any deep-learning python packages. NumPy is allowed. 

Upload your code onto your github repository with instructions on training and testing process in a README file. The trained model should be uploaded onto a cloud drive.
